#Application: Reminder Pro with redux

### Finished features:
- Add reminder
- Delete reminder
- Clear all reminders
- Store reminders in cookies

### Challenges to implement:
1. Add alert messages to the application if the current date passes the due date for a reminder.

2. Run `npm build` to find the build version of this application. Then, host it on a website so other users can use it!

3. Host the application on a database so multiple users can interact with the same reminders (Hint: the next application introduces authentication and databases, so perhaps you can revisit this one after).
